As you know, some package systems like to do certain things themselves. I've therefore made your life a little easier (and mine too when I'm doing the packaging) by providing configure options to disable parts of 'make install'.

For example, ./configure --disable-install_app (or --enable-install_app=no) will stop 'make install' installing the 4Pane binary.

The options are:
--enable-install_app                  Installs the 4Pane binary
--enable-install_rc                   Installs the resource files
--enable-install_docs                 Installs the help manual
--enable-locale                       Installs any ./locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/*.mo files
--enable-desktop                      Tries to create a 4Pane desktop shortcut
--enable-symlink                      Tries to make a 4Pane to 4pane symlink in the install dir

For all of them the default is 'yes'.
