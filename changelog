8.0
Compilation fixes when built against wxWidgets 3.2

When trying to extract an archive, recognise the 'xpi' extension: it's actually a zip

Provide a better context menu for the Terminal Emulator and CommandLine
  There are now Copy and Paste entries where appropriate.

Fix Terminal Emulator display glitches

Fix moving/pasting symlinks when Retain Relative Symlinks is true

7.0
Added support for GIO mounts
  Recent distro versions use GIO to mount some usb devices inside /run/user/<id>/gvfs/
  4Pane now looks there for automounted DVDs, cameras and smart devices e.g. android phones,
  and adds a toolbar button for each, just as would happen for a usb flash drive.

Improvements to the QuickFind dialog

Compilation fix for >=wxWidgets 3.1.4

6.0
4Pane no longer builds with wxWidgets 2.8; it now requires 3.0 or higher.

There's a faster way to reach the File OpenWith menu.
  Ctrl-Alt-doubleclick will now directly show the menu.

When moving or pasting files, optionally retain their previous modification date.

Support extracting/verifying 'rar' archives, if 'unrar' is installed, but not 'rar' creation.
  'unrar' is freely available (though with a licence restriction) but the 'rar' licence is too restricted.

Previewing images now supports svg files too.

Add support for the LXQt DE by recognising its default editor, terminal and image viewer.

5.0
There is a simpler 'Find' dialog for everyday use.
  Just as the QuickGrep dialog is good enough for most greps, a simple one-page QuickFind that sets just the path, pattern and search-type will be sufficient for most searches.

When large files are being moved or pasted, their progress is now displayed in the statusbar.
 
It is now possible to make a particular fileview order its files in a decimal-aware way.
  This is helpful in the case of files with names like foo1.txt, foo2.txt, foo11.txt, foo12.txt, which normally sort as 1, 11, 12, 2.
  A fileview's contextmenu now has an entry that makes it sort such files more intelligently.
  Note that this only affects files with names that _end_ in digits, not those with digits elsewhere in the name.

Building 4Pane now uses Automake.

4.0
Moving or pasting files now uses threads
  This allows 4Pane to be responsive even during pastes of very large files, and also makes it possible to cancel such pastes.

A better method of detecting a file's system mime-type is now used

4Pane can now be built with clang as well as with g++

3.0
It's now possible to use gtk3 instead of gtk2, providing the gtk3 version is sufficiently recent

4Pane now builds and runs on GNU Hurd, though some features are missing: in particular FilesystemWatcher and samba support

There is now an optional Preview feature: hovering over an image or a text file will, after a delay, show the contents in a 'tooltip'

Double-clicking on a file now uses the system's mime-type method to decide which application to use to open the file
  Previous versions used just 4Pane's built-in method. Now by default both are tried in turn, the system method first,
  but this can be changed in Options > Configuring 4Pane > Miscellaneous > Other

2.0
It's now possible to mount a remote partition over ssh, using sshfs.

4Pane now uses 'inotify' to keep it informed of changes to the filesystem. This means that the display updates
  to show altered dirs and files, whether they were changed by 4Pane itself or from elsewhere. This is enabled
  by default.

Any /etc/fstab entries for network mounts (nfs, sshfs and samba) are now added to their 'mount' dialogs

There's now a separate icon for broken symlinks.


1.0
For the musophobic, added the ability to use the keyboard to:
  navigate to/from the panes, terminal emulator, command-line and toolbar textctrl;
  return to the last-used control;
  navigate between dir-view and file-view, and to the opposite twinpane;
  cycle through multiple open tabs;

User-defined command parameters can now have modifiers, better to specify which panes to select from.

When the user does Copy on a treeitem, its filepath is now added to the (real) clipboard too.
  If 4Pane is built against >=wxGTK-2.9 it's also added to the primary selection.

It's now possible to set a background colour to panes, optionally different for dirviews and fileviews.

Added the ability to paste only the dirs in the clipboard, ignoring files.
 This makes it easy to replicate a directory tree.

A greater range of compressed files and archives can now be handled.
  Assuming the relevant system libs are installed:
  Files compressed with xz, lzma, lzop and compress can now be decompressed and (all but the last) compressed.
  Standard 7z archives can be extracted, and tar.7z ones created and extracted.
  Cpio and ar archives can be extracted, as can rpm and deb packages.
  It's also possible to peek inside tar archives compressed with xz (lzma1 or 2), in addition to gzip and bzip2.
There are now different tree icons to discriminate between archives, compressed archives and compressed files.

It's now possible to change which part of a filename is displayed in the 'ext' column of a fileview.
 By default an extension is still considered to start at the first '.', but it's now possible to change this
 to the last or the penultimate one.

4Pane now will (by default) use stock icons for such things as Copy and Undo. Improved some non-stock icons.

4Pane now acquires more information about newly-found usb devices, and may not have to bother the user about them.

There is now a built-in su/sudo front-end for executing commands with admin privileges.
 This is the default, but it's still possible to configure to use kdesu/gksu/etc/ instead



0.8.0
i18n-related improvements. There are now Italian and Danish translations available.
Prevent a spurious second item being select after a pane is refreshed.
Flag which is the currently-focused pane by subtly highlighting its header, or the top of its toolbar
Provide mnemonics for (most) menuitems
There's now a menu item 'Permanently Delete', which really deletes rather than just moving to a can
A user-defined tool can now be set to refresh one or both of the visible panes when it's finished running


0.7.0
Make the Options dialog (and several others) smaller, so they'll fit on the screen of e.g. a netbook
In the 'Terminals' tab of the options dialog, offer only installed terminals
Work around recent konsole versions that don't notice the pwd
Display dates according to the user's locale
By default, make both dirviews and fileviews LC_COLLATE-aware when sorting their contents
Adding a new nfs server address should now immediately display any available exports
Added a 'prefix linenumbers' checkbox to the QuickGrep dialog
Various bug-fixes and UI improvements when browsing inside archives;
 also it's now possible to overwrite files inside archives (instead of only being able to store duplicates)
Fixed bug 2808315 (crash on opening the font dialog)
Fixed a longstanding bug that caused i386 builds to fail to display correctly a filesize >4GB

0.6.0
Added a Quick-Grep dialog, for simpler everyday grepping.
Added a "Working Directory" option for "Open With" and Editors.
 This allows the running of (not-properly-installed) apps that need to be cd.ed to first
Added the User-defined Tools submenu to the Context menu
Made the regex help-page work!

0.5.1
When mounting a removable device partition that's not in /etc/fstab, 4Pane now attempts to mount -o uid=1000,gid=100 (or whatever).
 Whether this works depends on the partition's filesystem.
Changes to help distro packagers.
Made optional the wizard's creation of a desktop shortcut.
You can now choose, when Moving/Pasting a relative symlink, for its original target _not_ to be retained
Turned on i18n support.

Main bug-fixes: 
  Made the 'About' dialog work!
  In some distros/situations D'n'D Move was Copying instead.
	Corrected quoting/globbing problems with the terminal emulator and Grep dialog

0.5.0
First release.
Help and Configure.

0.4.3
Implemented "virtual" archives.
Implemented Multiple Rename and Duplicate.

0.4.2
Renaming of tabs, optionally hiding single tab-heads etc.
The Properties dialog can now do chown/chmod for multiple selections, and recursively.
Can now mount/umount dvdram discs.
Major changes to do with recognising fixed & usb devices when these are auto/supermounted.  Also changes to Mount to cope with lvm
Configurable shortcuts. Start of context-sensitive help.
User-defined Tools.

0.4.1
Mounting NFS, Sambe and loop devices. Implemented Linking via menu/keyboard: before it was just D'n'D.
It is now possible to select multiple files by Rt-dragging.

0.4.0
D'n'D is now done properly, with individualised images. User-defined dirview toolbar buttons.
Mount/Unmount of partitions. Filtering of a pane's display

0.3.5
Properties dialog. Duplicate file/dir. First attempt at usb-device detection. 

0.3.4
Fileview columns added

0.3.3
Horizontal tab splitting and unsplitting, save tab setup and tab templates. Tab duplication, swap panes.


0.3.2 
Added Locate, Find and Grep dialogs, and the Terminal Emulator to display their output. Beginnings of Archive management.

0.3.1	
Cut now works. UnRedo system improved to cope with it. Executable file can be launched by double-clicking, and "Open With" is available.

0.3.0	
Bookmarks fully working.  Add, delete and edit bookmarks and their folders.

0.2.5
The mini-toolbar in the dir-view now has working Directory Up, Forward and Back buttons.  The latter 2 have sidebar-buttons which call 
drop-down menus for multiple forward/back movement.  The selected dir or file is now displayed in an editable text-control on the toolbar.

0.2.0
Undo/Redo now fully implemented, including multiple levels.  Originally each undo-able action had to be redone separately.  Now they are
collected in clusters of associated actions, which is much more user-friendly.
Though still missing many features, Fileman is now my main file-manager, so it deserves to be called version 0.2

0.1.5
Tabs are working.  Create new tabs, delete them, Copy/Paste between them.

0.1.3
Removable storage devices are now autodetected, and icons for each loaded onto the toolbar.  Clicking these allows mounting etc
whereupon their contents can be accessed just as in standard directories.

0.1.2
Editors of the user's choice have icons on the main toolbar.  Clicking these launches the editor.  Dragging a file onto an icon launches
the editor with the file loaded.

0.1.0
Drag and Drop is functionally implemented. It's not yet beautiful, but I'm going to defer cosmetic improvements until everything else works!
Fileman is now become just about useful, at least for simple things, so let's call it 0.1

0.0.5
Copy/Paste and Linking now work.

0.0.2
Dir-views now can display either the whole tree, or just a selected branch.

0.0.1
For the first time, this project is recognisably a file-manager.  There are two views, each split into a directory view and a file view.
