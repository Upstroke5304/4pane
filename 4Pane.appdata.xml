 <description>
  <p>
   4Pane is a highly configurable Linux filemanager. It has dual twin-panes,
   each of which has a directory tree-view pane and a detailed-list pane for
   files.
  </p>
  <p>
   In addition to standard file manager things, it offers multiple undo and redo
    of most operations (including deletions), archive management including 
    'virtual browsing' inside archives, multiple renaming/duplication of files,
    a terminal emulator and user-defined tools.
