<h2><u>Main Features</u></h2>
<p>
4Pane is a multi-pane, detailed-list file manager, and is designed to be fully-featured without bloat.<br><br>

All of the standard file manager abilities e.g. Moving are available; and are made easier by <a href="Display.htm">the dual twin-pane format</a>, since you can display the source 
and destination directories at the same time, however far apart they may be in your filesystem.<br><br>

Navigation around the filesystem is made easier by the provision of <a href="Bookmarks.htm">Bookmarks</a>, user-defined GoTo buttons, and a history of "Recently-visited directories".<br><br>

Almost everything that you do with 4Pane, even deletion, can be <a href="UnRedo.htm">undone</a> and redone.<br><br>

Tar (compressed and uncompressed) and zip <a href="Archive.htm">archives</a> can be created and extracted in the normal way. Alternatively, most archive types can be 
<a href="ArchiveBrowse.htm">browsed</a>, their contents altered, individual files read or launched; all without opening the archive.<br><br>

If your distro doesn't automatically mount dvdroms, usbpens etc, 4Pane can <a href="Mount.htm">do it for you</a>. 
Any mounted device is easily accessed via its toolbar icon.<br><br>

4Pane does <a href="MultipleRenDup.htm">Multiple Renaming</a> or duplication of files, either by prepending/appending, incrementing or using Regular Expressions.<br><br>

You can extend 4Pane by creating your own <a href="ConfigureUserDefTools.htm">User-Defined Tools</a>.<br><br>

Apart from the twin-pane, detailed list nature of 4Pane, almost everything else is configurable. You're used to different shortcuts? Change to them. 
You want to use a different console? You can. Look <a href="Configure.htm">here</a> for details.<br><br><br>


See the <a href="FAQ.htm">FAQ</a> for reasons why certain "features" aren't part of 4Pane: 
why it's not a web-browser/ftp client/cd burner, and why there's no mimetype-detection.
