<h2><u>Keyboard navigation</u></h2>
<p>
I tend to use the mouse most of the time. However from version 1.0 there is more support for those who prefer to navigate from the keyboard.
<br><br>

There are keyboard shortcuts for:
<ul>
			<li>  Navigating between adjacent panes e.g. from a dir-view to the corresponding file-view.</li>
			<li>  Navigating to the opposite equivalent pane e.g. from a dir-view to the opposite dir-view.</li>
			<li>  Navigating to and from the panes, the toolbar text field, and (if open) the terminal emulator and the command-line.</li>
			<li>  Returning to the previous location (if it's still open).</li>
			<li>  Cycling through the tabs (should multiple tabs be visible).</li>
</ul>

These shortcuts are <a href="ConfiguringShortcuts.htm">configurable</a>, though as usual not all key combinations will work; some will be grabbed by gtk or your desktop environment. Most don't have default settings, so choose your own.
<br><br><br>

There are also the following ways of moving through a dir-view tree, which are set by the toolkit and can't be changed:<br>
<ul>
			<li>  The <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrows, as you'd expect, move up/down to the next visible directory.</li>
			<li>  The <b>Left</b> arrow moves to the parent directory.</li>
			<li>  The <b>Right</b> arrow unfolds the current directory if closed, and moves to the first child. If there isn't one, it moves down.</li>
			<li>  '<b>+</b>' unfolds the selected branch.</li>
			<li>  '<b>-</b>' folds the selected branch.</li>
			<li>  '<b>*</b>' toggles the fold state of the selected branch and all its children.</li>
</ul>
</p>
