<h2><u>Configuring Terminals</u></h2>
<p>
This is about both "real" terminals, and 4Pane's <a href="TerminalEm.htm">terminal emulator</a>. The first sub-page deals with terminals.<br><br>

4Pane uses terminals in three ways. It can launch a terminal application (e.g. xterm) via <i>Tools > Launch Terminal</i> (<b>Ctrl-T</b>); 
it can open a file in a terminal by <a href="Open.htm">double-clicking it (or using Open)</a>; 
and it can open an application in a terminal with a <a href="ConfigureUserDefTools.htm">user-defined tool</a>.<br><br>

The top three items on the page all have the same format. On the left is a list of common choices, with the currently-used one highlit. 
Select whichever you prefer from the list. To the right is a box for you to enter others if you wish (pressing OK adds each to the list).<br><br>

The first item lets you choose which application to use in "Launch Terminal"; if you write in a different one, you'll probably just need the application's name. 
The second does the same for Opening an application in a terminal, either directly or from a user-defined tool. This time the command will need an extra option e.g. "xterm -e", 
so if you add your own you'll need to know what you're doing. The third item is similar, but only for user-defined tools where you want the terminal to stay open 
once the command has ended so you can read the output e.g. "df -h". Again you'll need extra options, and not all terminals can do this (e.g. gnome-terminal).<br><br><br>


The other sub-page is for the terminal emulator and command-line.<br>
First the prompt. Type the format you want into the box. You can use normal characters, and also any of the following options:
<ul><li>%H is changed to the full hostname e.g. linux.joe.bloggs.com</li><li>%h is substituted by the hostname up to the first dot e.g. linux</li>
<li>%u is replaced by your username</li>
<li>%w becomes the current working directory</li><li>%W becomes the last segment only of the current working directory</li>
<li>%$ is substituted either by <b>$</b>, or by <b>#</b> if you are root.</li>
</ul>

You can also alter the font used in the terminal emulator and command-line. Click the "Change" button to select a different font, which will be displayed 
in the adjacent box if valid. There's also a "Use Default" button.
