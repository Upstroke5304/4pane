<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Why can't 4Pane be like other file managers and have icon-view/one-pane options?</b>
					There are already plenty of file managers that do that. 4Pane is for people (like me) who want the increased information 
				 that a list-view provides, and the ease of navigation that you get with a separate directory pane.</li><br>
	<li><b>OK, but I can't see all that information: with four panes there isn't enough screen width.</b><br>
					Well, there <i>is</i> a scrollbar... Anyway: 
								<ul><li>You can shrink other panes by dragging their vertical borders, giving more room to the file-view.</li>
												<li>You don't have to display all of the <a href="FileviewCols.htm">file-view columns</a>, only the ones that you're interested in.</li>
												<li>You can use <i>View > Unsplit Panes</i> so that only one pair of panes is displayed.</li>
								</ul></li><br>
	<li><b>Why doesn't 4Pane look up the mime-type of each file it displays?</b><br>
					Speed. Opening my /usr/bin directory containing several thousand files used to take less than a second in 4Pane, compared with 15 seconds 
					in Konqueror. Admittedly that was some time ago, and the difference is much less with a more modern computer. Nevertheless, why spend time 
					and cpu cycles checking when you hardly ever need to know the answers?</li><br>
	<li><b>Why isn't 4Pane an ftp client/web browser/dvdrom burner?</b><br>
					Because it's a file manager. It tries to do one thing, well. If you want to burn a dvdrom, use a dvdrom burner.</li><br>
	<li><b>Why doesn't 4Pane use the orthodox Commander-style shortcuts?</b><br>
					Because it doesn't try to be a Commander-style file manager. Apart from standard things like Ctrl-C for Copy, it uses a mixture of PowerDesk and Konqueror shortcuts. 
					However you can <a href="ConfiguringShortcuts.htm">configure</a> the shortcuts to suit your preferences.</li>
</ul>
